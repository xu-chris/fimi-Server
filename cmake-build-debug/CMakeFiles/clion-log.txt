CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:33 (CMAKE_POLICY):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0020 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Caffe" with any of
  the following names:

    CaffeConfig.cmake
    caffe-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Caffe" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Caffe_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Caffe"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
